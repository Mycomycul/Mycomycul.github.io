The project section is my first react app and the rest of the scripting including the slide nav and the image are vanilla js in slidenav.js

SVGs were mostly built in Adobe Illustrator or taken from ... . Icons are stored in a single XML file, hidden on the page and then copied as needed sso they don't have to be duplicated.
